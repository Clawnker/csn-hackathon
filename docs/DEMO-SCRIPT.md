## Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:10)
**[Show Hivemind logo/title card]**

> "What if AI agents could discover each other, negotiate fees, and get paid - all on Solana?"
>
> "This is Hivemind Protocol. Where agents find agents."

---

### The Problem (0:10 - 0:25)
**[Show diagram of siloed agents]**

> "Today, AI agents are siloed. They can't find each other. They can't pay each other. There's no economy."
>
> "We're building the missing layer - an orchestration protocol with x402 micropayments."

---

### Demo Start (0:25 - 0:40)

### Cost Preview (0:40 - 0:55)
**[Show cost preview popup]**

>
> "I confirm, and the swarm activates."

### Swarm Activation (0:55 - 1:25)

### Results (1:25 - 1:45)
